        <strong>Jørgen Christian Jensen,</strong><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross_for_Australia">VC</a>
        <P>(15 January 1891 – 31 May 1922) was a Danish-born <a href="#">Australian recipient</a> of the <a
                href="#">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest award for <a href="#">gallantry</a> in battle that could be
            awarded to a member of the <a href="#">Australian armed forces</a>. Jensen emigrated to Australia in 1909,
            becoming a British subject at <a href="#">Adelaide</a>, South Australia, in 1914. A sailor and labourer
            before <a href="#">World War</a> I, he enlisted in the <a href="#">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) in
            March 1915, serving with the <a href="#">10th Battalion</a> during the latter stages of the <a
                href="#">Gallipoli campaign</a>. After the Australian force withdrew to Egypt, Jensen was transferred to
            the newly formed <a href="#">50th Battalion</a>, and sailed for France with the unit in June 1916. On the <a
                href="#">Western Front</a>, he was wounded during the battalion's first serious action, the <a
                href="#">Battle of Mouquet Farm in August</a>, and only returned to his unit in late January 1917. On 2
            April, his battalion attacked the<a href="#">Hindenburg Outpost Line</a> at <a href="#">Noreuil</a> , where
            his actions leading to the capture of over fifty German soldiers resulted in the award of the Victoria
            Cross.</P>
        <P>In June 1917, the 50th Battalion was involved in the <a href="#">Battle of Messines</a>; the following month,
            Jensen, now a <a href="#">corporal</a>, was posted to a training unit in the United Kingdom. He returned to
            his battalion in October, and was promoted to temporary <a href="#">sergeant</a> in November. In March 1918,
            the German <a href="#">Spring Offensive</a> was launched, and Jensen fought with his battalion at <a
                href="#">Dernancourt</a> and <a href="#">Villers-Bretonneux</a>. Shortly after the Second Battle of
            Villers-Bretonneux, Jensen was on patrol when he received a severe head wound, and was evacuated to the
            United Kingdom, then repatriated to Australia, where he was discharged in Adelaide at the end of the war. He
            worked as a marine store dealer and married in 1921, but died the following year.</P>

        <hr>
        <p>Jørgen Christian Jensen was born on 15 January 1891 in <a href="#">Løgstør</a>, Denmark, the son of Jørgen
            Christian Jensen
            and Christiane Sørensen, who was apparently also known as Jensen.[1][2] Sørensen was a single mother who
            worked in agriculture. The younger Jensen's early life was difficult, but he was a good student, and entered
            the fishing industry.[3] In 1908, aged 17, he travelled to the United Kingdom before emigrating to
            Australia. He sailed to<a href="#">Melbourne</a> in March 1909,then moved to <a href="#">Morgan</a>, <a
                href="#">South Australia</a>, and later <a href="#">Port Pirie</a>
            , working respectively as a sailor on <a href="#">river steamers</a> on the <a href="#">Murray River</a>,
            and as a labourer. He was
            <a href="#">naturalised</a> as a British subject in <a href="#">Adelaide</a> on 7 September 1914.</p>

        <p>On 23 March 1915, Jensen enlisted as a <a href="#">private</a> in the <a href="#">Australian Imperial
                Force</a> (AIF) for service in <a href="#">World War</a>
            I; he was allotted to the 6th reinforcements to the <a href="#">10th Battalion</a>.His reinforcement draft
            embarked on
            HMAT Borda at <a href="#">Outer Harbor</a> on 23 June, and joined the battalion at <a
                href="#">Gallipoli</a>, Turkey, on 4 August.By the
            time Jensen arrived, nearly half of the battalion had been evacuated sick with <a href="#">dysentery</a>.For
            the remainder
            of the <a href="#">Gallipoli campaign</a>, the 10th Battalion rotated through various positions in the line
            defending the
            beachhead until withdrawn to <a href="#">Lemnos</a> in November.Jensen remained with his unit throughout,
            except for a week
            in September–October that he spent in hospital.The battalion embarked for Egypt in late November and spent
            the next four months training and assisting in the defence of the <a href="#">Suez Canal</a>. While in
            Egypt, the battalion
            was split into two, one half forming the nucleus of the new <a href="#">50th Battalion</a>, which was part
            of the <a href="#">13th Brigade</a>
            , <a href="#">4th Division</a>.In April 1916, Jensen and several other 10th Battalion men were transferred
            to the
            50th Battalion; later that month Jensen was charged for not being in his tent at <a href="#">tattoo</a>.On 5
            June the
            battalion embarked for France, arriving in <a href="#">Marseilles</a> six days later. The unit then
            entrained for the
            Western Front, entering the trenches for the first time on 28 June near <a href="#">Fleurbaix</a>.</p>

        <p>The 50th Battalion saw its first serious action during the <a href="#">Battle of Mouquet Farm</a> in
            mid-August 1916.During
            the battle, the 50th Battalion suffered 414 casualties, largely from the heavy German artillery
            bombardment.On 14 August, Jensen was hit in the left shoulder by a piece of <a href="#">shrapnel</a>. He was
            evacuated to
            the UK and admitted to <a href="#">Graylingwell War Hospital</a> in <a href="#">Chichester</a>, <a
                href="#">West Sussex</a>. While in the UK, he was charged
            with more disciplinary infractions in September, December and January, on one occasion being sentenced to 28
            days <a href="#">field punishment</a> for missing the troop train to return to France, and on another
            serving 12 days
            detention for being <a href="#">absent without leave</a> .He did not rejoin his unit until 28 January 1917.
        </p>

        <p>50th Battalion continued to rotate through front line, support and reserve positions, and underwent training
            in rear areas.[17] The battalion was also involved in pursuing the Germans as they withdrew to the
            <a href="#">Hindenburg Line</a> of fortifications. On 2 April, the 13th Brigade attacked the Hindenburg
            Outpost Line at
            <a href="#">Noreuil</a>.The attack consisted of the <a href="#">51st Battalion</a> attacking the village
            from the north, and the 50th
            Battalion from the south.During this assault, which was preceded by a weak artillery barrage, the 50th
            Battalion suffered extraordinary difficulties, and the centre company, to which Jensen belonged, was forced
            to detach a party of men equipped with a large number of <a href="#">hand grenades</a> (then known as bombs)
            to deal with a
            strongly barricaded German post that was holding out between their company and the one on their right.
            Jensen was a member of this party.His actions during the reduction of this post resulted in a recommendation
            for the <a href="#">Victoria Cross</a>,the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a
            member of the
            <a href="#">Australian armed forces</a> at that time.He was assisted in his actions by Private William
            Quinlan O'Connor and
            four others.The recommendation read
            At Noreuil on 2nd April 1917, this man took charge of five men and attacked a barricade behind which were
            40/50 Germans with a machine gun. One of his men shot down the German gunner. Jensen who is a Dane, then
            rushed the whole post singlehanded and threw a bomb in. He had still a bomb in one hand and taking another
            from his pocket he drew the pin with his teeth. Threatening them with two bombs, he called on them in German
            to surrender and bluffed them that they were surrounded by Australians. The enemy dropped their rifles and
            gave in. Jensen then sent a German to tell another enemy party who were fighting our Stokes Gun to surrender
            and they too gave in. A different party of our men then saw these Germans for the first time and began
            firing on them. At considerable risk, Jensen stood up on the barricade, waved his helmet, and sent the
            German prisoners back to our line under an escort of lightly wounded men.</p>

        <p>During the assault on Noreuil, Jensen also freed Australian prisoners, and assisted in the "mopping-up" of
            German resistance in the village itself when he captured a German officer or non-commissioned officer, who
            pointed out which building the fire was coming from.The 50th Battalion suffered 360 casualties, including 95
            dead, and captured 70 Germans, nearly all of whom were taken by Jensen and his party.O'Connor was awarded
            the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his part in capturing the German post.On 4 April, Jensen was promoted to
            lance corporal.His award of the Victoria Cross appeared in The London Gazette on 8 June,by which time the
            50th Battalion was involved in the Battle of Messines,suffering 149 casualties.After being relieved, the
            battalion continued its rotation through front line, support and reserve positions.</p>

            other VC recipients</p>
        <hr>
        <p>In July 1917, Jensen was temporarily promoted to corporal and transferred to the 13th Training Battalion at
            Codford in the UK as an instructor. While there, he was entertained by Danish residents of Kingston upon
            Hull. After another disciplinary infringement, he returned to France, rejoining his battalion on 6 October.
            He was temporarily promoted to sergeant in early November, and the battalion spent the winter of 1917–18
            rotating through the front line. In late March 1918, the battalion left its rest area and, along with many
            other Australian units, was quickly deployed to meet the German Spring Offensive south of the River Ancre.
            On 5 April, the battalion took up positions at Dernancourt and there contributed to the defeat of the
            "largest German attack mounted against Australian troops during the war" during the Second Battle of
            Dernancourt.</p>

        <p>The fighting at Dernancourt was followed by a move to the Villers-Bretonneux sector, where, on 25 April, the
            battalion took part in the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux that drove the Germans from that village, at
            a cost to the battalion of 254 casualties.On 5 May, Jensen was on patrol near Villers-Bretonneux when he was
            shot in the head. Severely wounded, he was admitted to hospital in France, and on 18 May was evacuated to
            the UK, where he was admitted to the Richmond Military Hospital in Surrey.</p>

        <p>Jensen reverted to the rank of corporal on being evacuated. Following two weeks' leave, he was repatriated to
            Australia, along with nine other Victoria Cross recipients, in August 1918 to take part in a recruiting
            campaign on the invitation of Prime Minister Billy Hughes.He disembarked in Adelaide on 11 October, and was
            discharged from the AIF on 2 December.[33] He was assessed to be partially disabled, and received a small
            pension.[3] For his service during the war, as well as his Victoria Cross he was issued the 1914–15 Star,
            British War Medal and Victory Medal.</p>
